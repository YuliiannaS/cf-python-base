## Data Structure Justification

I chose Python dictionaries to represent individual recipes because they allow for easy and clear mapping of recipe attributes like name, cooking time, and ingredients. Lists are used to store multiple recipes in the `all_recipes` structure because lists maintain order and provide flexibility to access, add, or modify recipes sequentially as required. This setup supports efficient data management and retrieval for recipe-related operations.
