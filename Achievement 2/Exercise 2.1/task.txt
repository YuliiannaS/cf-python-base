1. Why Django is Popular Among Web Developers

Django is popular because it allows developers to build web applications quickly and with less code. It provides a lot of built-in tools for common web development tasks and adheres to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, which keeps the code base clean and maintainable. Additionally, its robust security features are highly valued in developing secure websites.

3. Scenarios for Using Django

Developing a web application with multiple users: Use Django because it has built-in support for handling user authentication, sessions, and user roles, which are essential for a multi-user application.
Need fast deployment and the ability to make changes: Use Django as it offers rapid development with its extensive libraries and templating engine, making it ideal for projects that need to evolve over time.
Building a very basic application without database or file operations: Do not use Django. It might be overkill for such simple needs. A lightweight framework or even a simple static site might be more appropriate.
Building an application from scratch with full control: Use Django if you are comfortable with its structure; it's very customizable and extensible. However, if you need control over every aspect of the system, a micro-framework might offer more flexibility.
Starting a big project with potential need for support: Use Django because it has a large and active community, which can be a great resource when you encounter challenges. The extensive documentation and community support can help you troubleshoot and learn throughout the project.
